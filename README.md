## Election Audit Summary
The script was modified to update the election votes by candidate and adding in the county majority as well. By adjusting the code to 
now include the county data it could include the results for what county had the highest outcome of votes. This will be an easy way to make changes to track any of the data on the csv file due to the fact the candidate script and the county script is almost the same with
minor changes to the defined codes.
